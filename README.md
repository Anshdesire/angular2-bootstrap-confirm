# angular2-bootstrap-confirm
An angular2 bootstrap confirmation popover

WIP - just testing publishing to npm works, docs coming VERY soon!

TODO now
* documentation

Future extensions
* Git commit message, auto changelog setup
* Tests
* Web worker / universal compatibility -> blocked on needing features from angular for off click and positioning services
* Upgrade to angular RC0 -> blocked on https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-bootstrap being upgraded
* Append to body -> need something like: https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/core/pull/174
* Custom template -> unsure how to do this
