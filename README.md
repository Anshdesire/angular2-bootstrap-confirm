# angular2-bootstrap-confirm
An angular2 bootstrap confirmation popover

TODO now
* create production / dist bundle with typings emitted
* documentation
* publish to npm

Future extensions
* Git commit message, auto changelog setup
* Tests
* Web worker / universal compatibility -> blocked on needing features from angular for off click and positioning services
* Upgrade to angular RC0 -> blocked on https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-bootstrap being upgraded
* Append to body -> need something like: https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/core/pull/174
* Custom template -> unsure how to do this
